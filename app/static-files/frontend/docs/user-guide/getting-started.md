# Getting Started

Welcome to the Native American Languages Archive (NAL) management system! This guide will help you navigate and use the various features of the platform.

## Overview {#getting-started-overview}

The NAL system provides tools for:
- Managing languoid data (languages, dialects, families)
- Cataloging cultural items and collections
- Tracking collaborators and contributors
- Batch editing and importing data

## Navigation

Use the navigation bar on the left side of the page to access different sections:
- **Languoids** - Browse and edit language data
- **Items** - Manage language materials cultural artifacts grouped by catalog number
- **Collections** - Organize items into collections
- **Collaborators** - Track associated people

## Basic Workflow

1. **Browse** - Use the list views to find existing records
2. **Filter** - Apply filters to narrow down results
3. **Edit** - Click on a record to view and edit details
4. **Batch Edit** - Select multiple records for efficient bulk editing

## Navigating Lists

All list pages (Items, Collections, Collaborators, Languages) support flexible navigation to help you work efficiently.

### Opening Records

You have two ways to open a record from any list:

1. **Click on the primary identifier** (catalog number, collaborator name, collection abbreviation, languoid name)
   - These are proper links that support right-click → "Open in new tab"
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Click to open in a new tab
   - Middle-click (mouse wheel) to open in a new tab
   - Perfect for comparing multiple records side-by-side

2. **Click anywhere else on the row**
   - Convenient for quick navigation
   - Opens in the same tab
   - Fastest way to browse records

### Tips for Efficient Navigation

- **Open multiple tabs:** Right-click identifiers when you need to reference several records at once
- **Quick browsing:** Click rows directly when moving through records sequentially
- **Keyboard navigation:** Tab to the identifier link and press Enter to open, or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter for a new tab
- **Screen readers:** The identifiers are properly announced as links with descriptive labels
