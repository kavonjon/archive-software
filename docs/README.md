## Getting Started

### For Developers

1. Read the main [README.md](../README.md)
2. Set up your development environment (coming soon)
3. Review [Dependencies](dependencies.md)
4. Explore the [Context Memory](../context/) for architectural decisions

### For Operations/Deployment

1. **TrueNAS Scale Deployment:**
   - Follow [Database Operations Guide](deployment/database-operations.md)
   - Use `deploy-restore-db-private.sh` for database management
   - Use `deploy-update-private.sh` for code updates

2. **Standard Docker Deployment:**
   - Use `deploy.sh` with appropriate `.env` configuration
   - See main [README.md](../README.md) for basic setup

---

## Project Architecture

### Dual-Server Design

The Archive Software uses a sophisticated dual-server architecture:

- **Private Server** (TrueNAS Scale) - Complete archive with all files and metadata
- **Public Server** - Curated subset for public API access

**Key Features:**
- Seven storage volumes for security and data flow
- Virus scanning at multiple pipeline stages
- Event-driven database synchronization
- Cultural sensitivity-based access control (4 levels)

For detailed architecture decisions, see the [Context Memory](../context/core/architectural_decisions.json).

---

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Django 5.0.14 (LTS)
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Celery + Redis
- Gunicorn

### Frontend
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Material-UI
- Redux Toolkit
- Axios

### Deployment
- Docker + Docker Compose
- TrueNAS Scale 25 Apps
- Nginx reverse proxy

---

## Cultural Context

This software serves the Native American Languages Archive at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, University of Oklahoma. All technical decisions must respect:

- **Cultural sensitivity** - Materials require graduated access control
- **Community control** - Indigenous communities maintain authority over their materials
- **Language preservation** - Supporting language revitalization efforts
- **Anonymous protection** - Some contributors require anonymity for cultural safety

See [Cultural Context](../context/domain/cultural_context.json) for more details.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:

1. Review the [Context Memory](../context/) to understand project history and decisions
2. Follow established coding patterns (see [Coding Patterns](../context/development/coding_patterns.json))
3. Respect preservation rules (see [Preservation Rules](../context/boundaries/preservation_rules.json))
4. Ensure ADA compliance for all UI changes
5. Test on multiple devices for responsive design

---

## Getting Help

### Documentation Issues

If you find documentation that is:
- Outdated
- Unclear
- Missing important information

Please update it! Documentation is code.

### Technical Issues

1. Check the [Context Memory](../context/) for architectural decisions
2. Review the [Technical Debt Registry](../context/evolution/technical_debt_registry.json)
3. Consult operation-specific guides in this docs directory
